# Laravel Reverb: Real-Time Chat App (Modified)

This is a modified version of the original **Laravel Reverb Real-Time Chat App** tutorial by [BoolFalse](https://boolfalse.com/), based on a [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/laravel-reverb-realtime-chat-app/).

> âœ¨ **Update**: UI changes have been made to the **Login**, **Registration**, and **Email Verification** pages. More modifications are in progress as the app is being customized further.

Reverb is a first-party WebSocket server for Laravel applications, bringing real-time communication between client and server. This app uses Laravel (backend) and React.js with Vite.js (frontend) to implement a modern, real-time chat system.
